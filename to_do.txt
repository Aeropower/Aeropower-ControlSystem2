-Assemble push buttons and connect them to MCU and test LCD module DONE
-Look for a better debouncing mechanism like a SR latch
-Figure out how to put the MCU into light sleep on stall DONE
-Start figuring out the emergency control using the TI power mux or relays
-Build a proper interface for the temperature sensor and the ADC and calibrate
-Test rpm and pulse counter. 
-Test LCD and Sensors tasks to see if we can get data from the turbine. 

-Divide FSM and test each state separately, then check if they work together.
